### **1. Comments in JavaScript**

- Comments help explain the code but do not affect execution.
- **Single-line comment:**
    
    ```js
    // This is a single-line comment
    console.log("This will run");
    ```
    
- **Multi-line comment:**
    
    ```js
    /*
      This is a multi-line comment
      It can span multiple lines
    */
    console.log("Multi-line comments ignored");
    ```
    

### **2. Case Sensitivity**

- JavaScript is **case-sensitive**.
- `myVariable` and `MyVariable` are different.

**Example (Incorrect Usage):**

```js
let Name = "John";
console.log(name); // Error: name is not defined
```
