### **History & Usage**

- Created in **1995** by Brendan Eich.
- Originally used for making web pages interactive.
- Now used for both **frontend** (browser) and **backend** (servers with Node.js).

### **Why JavaScript for Backend Development?**

- Runs on **Node.js**, allowing JavaScript to be executed outside the browser.
- **Asynchronous** nature makes it great for handling multiple requests at once.
- Huge **community support** and a wide range of tools (Express.js, MongoDB, etc.).
