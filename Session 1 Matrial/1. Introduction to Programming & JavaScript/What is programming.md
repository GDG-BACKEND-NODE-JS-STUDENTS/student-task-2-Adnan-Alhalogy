Before jumping into JavaScript, students should understand what programming is:  

- Programming is **giving instructions** to a computer to perform tasks.  
- Computers follow **sequential steps** to solve problems.  
- Programming languages act as **bridges** between humans and computers.  
- JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages, mainly used for web development.
